`MotrixLab` is a reinforcement learning framework based on the [MotrixSim](https://github.com/Motphys/motrixsim-docs) simulation engine, designed specifically for robot simulation and training. This project provides a complete reinforcement learning development platform that integrates multiple simulation environments and training frameworks.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two core components:

-   **motrix_envs**: Various RL simulation environments built on MotrixSim, defining observation, action, and reward. Framework-agnostic and currently supports MotrixSim's CPU backend
-   **motrix_rl**: Integrates RL frameworks and uses various environment parameters from motrix_envs for training. Currently supports SKRL framework's PPO algorithm

> Documentation: https://motrixlab.readthedocs.io

## Key Features

-   **Unified Interface**: Provides a concise and unified reinforcement learning training and evaluation interface
-   **Multi-backend Support**: Supports JAX and PyTorch training backends, with flexible selection based on hardware environment
-   **Rich Environments**: Includes various robot simulation environments such as basic control, locomotion, and manipulation tasks
-   **High-performance Simulation**: Built on MotrixSim's high-performance physics simulation engine
-   **Visual Training**: Supports real-time rendering and training process visualization

## 🚀 Quick Start

> The following examples use the Python project management tool: [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
>
> Before starting, please [install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) this tool.

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Motphys/MotrixLab

cd MotrixLab

git lfs pull
```

### Install Dependencies

Install all dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --all-packages --all-extras
```

SKRL framework supports JAX(Flax) or PyTorch as training backends. You can also choose to install only one training backend based on your hardware environment:

Install JAX as training backend (Linux only):

```bash
uv sync --all-packages --extra skrl-jax
```

Install PyTorch as training backend:

```bash
uv sync --all-packages --extra skrl-torch
```

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Environment Visualization

View environments without executing training:

```bash
uv run scripts/view.py --env cartpole
```

### Model Training

```bash
uv run scripts/train.py --env cartpole
```

Training results are saved in the `runs/{env-name}/` directory.

View training data through TensorBoard:

```bash
uv run tensorboard --logdir runs/{env-name}
```

### Model Inference

```bash
uv run scripts/play.py --env cartpole
```
